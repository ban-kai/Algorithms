Fresh engineer. Social, ambitious and open-minded. Discovered coding which led to technology and startup enthusiast. By day, full stack developer, by night, an avid geek with an insatiable hunger for knowledge and growth. I've been playing around with Java languages on the backend for a while and I am friends with some JavaScript family members such as ReactJS on the frontend. Sometimes I switch playgrounds so I can have a bite of Android.
