Fresh engineer. Social, ambitious and open-minded.. and then I discovered coding which led to technology and start-up enthusiast. By day, full stack developer, by night an avid nerd with an insatiable hunger for knowledge and growth. I've been playing around with Java languages on the backend for a while and I am friends with some JavaScript family members such as ReactJS on the frontend. Sometimes I switch playgrounds so I can have a bite of Android.
